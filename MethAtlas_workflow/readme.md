This part primarily demonstrates the workflow of the MethAtlas method. If you intend to practically apply this section's code, it is recommended to modify relevant paths and some parameter settings according to your specific requirements.
The sequence of steps to follow is:
1. Commence with running the ref_atlas_select.py script, which generates MethAtlas's Reference Methylation Atlas for each distinct depth filter level.
2. Next, proceed to execute the gen_mixture.py script, thereby creating FullAtlas.csv files tailored for every individual depth filtering condition.
3. Continue with invoking other script files as necessary to perform corresponding procedures.

It is highly recommended to consult the user guide and preparation detailed within the MethAtlas project on GitHub at https://github.com/nloyfer/meth_atlas prior to implementing any part of this codebase in your work.
