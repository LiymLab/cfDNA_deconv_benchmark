This segment plays a pivotal role in handling data preprocessing for the entire benchmarking endeavor. The foundational dataset we work with here comprises .pat.gz and .beta files.

The ordered workflow proceeds as:

The first step entails generating a pair of distribution files that are essential for constructing mixtures in ensuing research endeavors.
Subsequently, engage in comprehensive data preprocessing activities, encompassing data classification and the meticulous production of datasets indispensable for progressing studies.


In the event that your starting point is bam files, it is advisable to preliminarily undergo pertinent transformation procedures by employing wgbstools, which can be found within the official repository at https://github.com/nloyfer/wgbs_tools/tree/master. This step ensures that your data is appropriately formatted for further analysis in the context of this study.
