This segment plays a pivotal role in handling data preprocessing for the entire benchmarking endeavor. The foundational dataset we work with here comprises .pat.gz and .beta files.

The ordered workflow proceeds as:

1. Generate two distribution files to facilitate the creation of cfdna mixtures in subsequent research.
2. Perform data preprocessing, including categorization and the generation of data required for further study.


In the event that your starting point is bam files, it is advisable to preliminarily undergo pertinent transformation procedures by employing wgbstools, which can be found within the official repository at https://github.com/nloyfer/wgbs_tools/tree/master. This step ensures that your data is appropriately formatted for further analysis in the context of this study.
